The vulnerability occurs in this file /utility/update.php, it only judges whether the parameters are correct, it does not verify whether it is in the login state, and it does not declare authentication permissions such as session or token.

The site can be closed without authorization by accessing the url:
http://127.0.0.1:9090/utility/update.php?step=start
And he will start to check the database, and automatically jump an id after checking a table, here we can directly traverse the data table 1-260.

From the source code of the file, we can see that we can skip any steps:


elseif ($_GET['step'] =='sql') {

Here ['step'] =='sql' where sql is the step of our program execution (url:update.php?step=sql), start is the beginning, starting from line 108, except for start, we can execute delete or Other commands:

http://127.0.0.1:9090/utility/update.php?step=delete

Tips:
/utility/update.php

maybe is:

/data/update.php
